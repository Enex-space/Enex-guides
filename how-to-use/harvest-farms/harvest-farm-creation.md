# ⚙ Harvest Farm creation

First - to create a farm you need to go to wallet.enecuum.com, log in to the web-wallet using a private key, Enecuum Extension or enecuum mobile application(PWA).

Next, select Create Farm.

You will see the farm creation interface:

Where:

* Stake token - in the case of creating a Harvest Farm - LP token that farm users will stake.
* Reward token - the reward token that farm users will receive.
* Block reward is the reward in the selected tokens that will be distributed between the farm users each block (the reward is distributed between the farm's stake holders depending on their share in the total volume of the harvested asset).
* Emission - the amount of reward tokens that the creator plans to distribute through the farm.
* Blocks left - how many blocks in the Enecuum network the specified reward is enough for, a block comes out about every 15 seconds. There are approximately 5,760 blocks in a day.

It is better to search for the right LP-Token by Id (hash):
