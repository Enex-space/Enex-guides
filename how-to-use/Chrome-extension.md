## Getting Started with Enecuum Extension

### Installing Enecuum Browser Extension

## Go to app.enex.space and click **Connect** in the top right corner:

![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-install-start.png)

The following window appears. Click **Get Enecuum browser extension** to proceed:

![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-install-get-extension.png)

Chrome Web Store opens. Click **Add to Chrome** and confirm the installation by clicking **Add Extension** in the pop-up that appears:

![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-install-chrome-web-store.png)

![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-install-confirmation.png)

Once the installation is complete, click ![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-install-ext-icon.png) _Extensions_ icon to the right of Chrome address bar and click on Enecuum to open the extension. You will be asked to set up a password for the extension:

![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-install-set-ext-password.png)

When you're done setting up the password, you'll be taken to Enecuum extension start view:

![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-create-or-login.png)

Here you can either create a new wallet or log into an existing one. The following sections will describe how to do this.

### Creating a Wallet

1 In the start view, click **Generate**. The generated mnemonic phrase will appear:

![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-create-mnemonic.png)

If you do not like the mnemonic phrase that was generated, click **Back** to go back to the start view and then click **Generate** to generate a new mnemonic phrase.

If you like the mnemonic phrase that was generated, click **Next** to continue with the creation of your new wallet.

**VERY IMPORTANT**: If you decide to proceed with the generated mnemonic phrase, **back the mnemonic phrase up** before clicking **Next**. You will not be able to recover your mnemonic phrase once the wallet is created. To copy it into the clipboard, click **Copy**.

Also, before you proceed to the next step, keep the mnemonic phrase at hand.

2 Click **Next**. You will be asked twice to pick the correct word from the mnemonic phrase you have just generated:

![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-create-mnemonic-select.png)

Click on the word and then click **Next**. When you've successfully picked both requested words, you'll be taken to the view of your new wallet:

![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-wallet-empty.png)

Once created, your wallet is not connected to any network. To connect your wallet to the network you started with, click **Connect** on app.enex.space:

![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-install-start.png)

Click **ENQ Wallet**:

![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-wallet-connect-to-network.png)

A confirmation window opens. Click **Allow** to proceed:

![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-wallet-connect-confirmation.png)

You are now connected to the network. You can see this in the top right corner of ENEX view:

![foo](../.gitbook/assets/ext-wallet-enex-connected.png)

Here you can see the following:

* Name of the network (BIT)
* Balance of your wallet in (**which tokens?**)
* Address of your wallet

### Logging into an Existing Wallet

To log into an existing wallet, open Enecuum extension, enter the mnemonic phrase for the wallet and click **Login**.

You will be taken straight to the wallet view (see above).
