# ðŸ›° Station (IN PROGRESS)

The rationale behind **Station**, much as with **Harvest Farms**, is to encourage ENEX.SPACE users to keep ENX liquidity in liquidity pools. 

When a transaction is performed on **ENEX.SPACE**, 0.05% of the transaction fee, in LP tokens, goes to the Treasury Fund. If a user has a stake in a liquidity pool that holds both LP tokens and ENX tokens, he can call Distribute to trade the LP tokens in the pool for ENX and distribute them to the stakeholders of the pool, in proportion to their stakes. 

Possible actions: 

(Harvest) to collect the due rewards of a single user that triggers Harvest.

(Distribute) distributing rewards to all stakeholders in the token pool, in proportion to their stakes. 

- pools available for a user

** Name: ENEX.SPACE pool name
** ENEX Treasury: amount of LP tokens accrued from transaction fees
** Estimation: estimated ENX amount to be shared once Distribute is called
** ENX price in pool: the approximate ENX price in pools that take part in the Station
** Price impact: the difference in the token's price before and after the distribution is made.
