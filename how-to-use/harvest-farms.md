# ðŸ§‘ðŸŒ¾ Harvest Farms

Well, yield farming is **the process of using decentralized finance (DeFi) to maximize returns**. Users lend or borrow crypto on a DeFi platform and earn cryptocurrency in return for their services. \
\
The **Harvest Farm** allows users to yield farm **$ENX** rewards based on staking LP tokens. \
The Farm is meant to motivate liquidity providers to hold their liquidity in pools. It can be effective either for liquidity of new tokens brought to [**ENEX.SPACE**](https://enex.space/), or for increasing liquidity in existing pools.&#x20;

## How To Use Farms

### Providing liquidity to get LP Tokens

Youâ€™re going to need some "LP Tokens" to enter into a Farm with. Farms can only accept their own exact LP Token. To do this, you should read the following page. There you will find all the necessary information on how to get LP Tokens.

{% content-ref url="pool.md" %}
[pool.md](pool.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Putting your LP Tokens into the Farm

In the window, you will see the **Stake LP\_TKN** button. Click it and a new window will appear.

![stake LP\_TKN](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

Type the amount of LP Tokens you would like to farm into the field, or just click **MAX** to use all of your LP Tokens. When you have the amount entered, the **Confirm** button will light up. Click it. Your wallet will ask you to confirm your action.

After a while, the window will close, and you will see your new staked LP Token balance in the details.

### Adding or removing LP Tokens from a Farm

You may decide you would like to **add more** LP Tokens to a Farm at a later date, or to **take some out** of a Farm. You can do this very easily whenever you'd like. \
You will see a **-** and **+** buttons below your tokens. Click **-** to remove LP Tokens, or **+** to add more LP Tokens.

![adding or removing LP tokens](<../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png>)

A window will open that looks like the one you used earlier to first stake your LP Tokens. Like last time, type the amount you would like to **unstake/stake**, or click **MAX** to remove/add all available LP Tokens.

Make sure your information is correct. When you are ready, click the **Confirm** button and confirm the action in your wallet.\
After your confirmation, your new balance will show up in the details section of your LP Token pair.

### Collecting your farming rewards

Farming will bring you ENX rewards over time. You can collect these rewards and use them to get more LP Tokens, stake them in Pools, or anything else youâ€™d like.&#x20;

Click the **Harvest** button and confirm the action in your wallet. Finally, the ENX Tokens will be claimed to your wallet for you to use as you like.
