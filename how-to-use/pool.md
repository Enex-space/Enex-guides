## How to Use It and How to Manage

The Pool is a mechanism to reward users who provides liquidity to the DEX. A Pool can be created by any user in the world. \
After the pool is created it can be filled up with assets. As long as pool has asset all stakeholders are rewarded with fees from each trade proportionally to their total liquidity share.\
Each stakeholder can do any actions with his liquidity (increase, decrease or take away) or take reward any time.&#x20;

So, below are **screenshots** of the **Pool** location:&#x20;

## **Add Liquidity**

You provide tokens to the liquidity pool in a current pool's ratio. \
As an example, given the 1:100.000.000 BIT-SOS ratio in the pool, you should add simultaneously **10 $BIT** and **1.000.000.000 $ENQ** liquidity ($$\frac{10}{100000000} = \frac{1}{10}$$ ). ****&#x20;

When you add your token to a liquidity pool, you will receive **LP tokens** (liquidity provider tokens).\
For instance, if you deposit **$BIT** and **$SOS** into a liquidity pool, you will receive _BIT-SOS LP_ tokens.

The number of LP tokens you own shows your share of the BIT-SOS liquidity pool. You can always take your funds back by sending your LP tokens in exchange for **$BIT** and **$SOS**. But the proportion of $BIT and $SOS may vary based on the price change in the BIT-SOS pool. It is the risk the Liquidity Provider takes in exchange for the pool fees.

Next, you will see the baby-window again, waiting for you to confirm the operation in your wallet.

After all the confirmations, you will be notified that the transaction was successful. Moreover, you will be asked to view information about the operation.&#x20;

## Create a Pool

If the pool you wish to provide liquidity to does not exist, you can create it by yourself with the same procedure as adding liquidity. \
As the first liquidity provider, you set the initial exchange ratio (price). This often quickly corrects itself through arbitrage and by more liquidity providers adding to the pool.

By the way, at [**ENEX**](https://devapp.enex.space/#!action=pool\&pair=BIT-ENX\&from=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\&to=824e7b171c01e971337c1b25a055023dd53c003d4aa5aa8b58a503d7c622651e) **** you can create a liquidity pool with any token, issued over Enecuum Network and any tokens â€” any to any (A2A).&#x20;
