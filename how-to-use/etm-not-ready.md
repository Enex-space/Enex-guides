# ðŸŽ° ETM (not ready)

Via ETM you can easily issue custom token to be deployed on the Enecuum blockchain. 

(tokenomics to be added)

![ETM interface](<../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png>)

The next thing you will see is options for your future token on the ENQ.&#x20;

![issue token block](<../.gitbook/assets/image (44).png>)

The parameters are as follows:

* **Ticker** - the shorthand for the token, three or (a few more) letters, will be displayed in most places on ENEX.SPACE
* **Name** - full name of the token (as opposed to the ticker)
* **Token Type** - there are three types (that are somewhat overlapping, to be checked), non-reissuable (fixed emission size), reissuable (allows for additional admission), and mineable (can be mined) - to be recovered from the API description. 
* **Emission** - token emission volume
* **Decimals** - (is this even relevant for the mining of a token?)
* **Fee type** - transaction fee type / tokens in which the transaction fee is charged (to be checked against the API description)
* **Fee** - ???

--> (so much more to add)
