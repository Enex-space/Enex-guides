# ðŸŽ° ETM (not ready)

Via ETM you can easily issue custom token to be deployed on the Enecuum blockchain. 

(tokenomics to be added)

The next thing you will see is options for your future token on the ENQ.&#x20;

![issue token block](<../.gitbook/assets/image (44).png>)

The parameters are as follows:

* **Ticker** - short name of the token, comprising three or (a few more) letters. It will be displayed in most places on ENEX.SPACE.
* **Name** - full name of the token
* **Token Type** - we need to elaborate on that, but that's how it goes along the API documentation: 
* * _reissuable_ - a token with a flexible supply, that is, after the initial release the supply can be increased (_minted_) or decreased (_burned_). There is no maximum token supply restriction.
* * _non-reissuable_ - a token with a fixed supply, that is, after the initial release the amount of tokens cannot be changed
* * _mineable_ - a token that, once released with an initial supply, can be mined by users until the maximum token supply cap is reached.  
* **Emission** - token emission volume (equal to total supply in the API? what to we do with mineable tokens, then, how do we set max_supply for them?)
* **Decimals** - 
* **Fee type** - transaction fee type & tokens in which the transaction fee is charged:
* * _Flat_ - a fixed fee paid out to the token's issuer in _reward tokens_.
* * _Percentage_ - a fee calculated as a percentage of the transaction's sum paid out to the token's issuer in _reward tokens_. 
* * _Native_ - a fixed fee paid out to the token's issuer in the network's _native tokens_
* **Fee** - Fee amount (nominated in accordance with the fee type setting)
