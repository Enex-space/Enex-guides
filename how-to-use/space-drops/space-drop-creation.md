# âš™ Space Drop creation

First - to create a Space Drop you need to go to wallet.enecuum.com, log in to the web-wallet using a private key, Enecuum Extension or enecuum mobile application(PWA).

Next, select Create Farm.

You will see the farm creation interface:

Where:

* Stake token - in the case of creating a Space Drop - non-LP token that Drop users will stake.
* Reward token - the reward token that Drop users will receive.
* Block reward is the reward in the selected tokens that will be distributed between the Drop users each block (the reward is distributed between the Drop's stake holders depending on their share in the total volume of the harvested asset).
* Emission - the amount of reward tokens that the creator plans to distribute through the Space Drop.
* Blocks left - how many blocks in the Enecuum network the specified reward is enough for, a block comes out about every 15 seconds. There are approximately 5,760 blocks in a day.

It is better to search for the right Token by Id (hash):

In the example, the Drop will run for \~10,000,000 blocks or \~1,736 days:
